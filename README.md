# Decentralized Identity Project in Rust

## Overview
The **Decentralized Identity** project is implemented in Rust and aims to provide a secure and efficient way to manage digital identities using decentralized technologies. This project demonstrates how to create and verify decentralized identities through the use of cryptographic principles.

## Features
- **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)**: Create and manage unique identifiers.
- **Verifiable Credentials**: Issue and verify credentials securely.
- **Rust Implementation**: Leverages Rust's performance and safety features.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (version 1.50 or higher)
- Cargo (Rust's package manager, which comes with Rust installation)
